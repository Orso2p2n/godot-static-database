# Godot Static Database

**Godot Static Database** is a Godot addon that adds a panel with which you can automatically create a static script that hold references to all the resources in a specified folder.

It works both with C# and GDScript.

It is currently functional and usable but slightly unstable, and might require a project reload to function properly at times.

# How to install

1. Download the repository
2. Drag and drop the "addons" folder into your Godot project's root folder.
3. Done!
